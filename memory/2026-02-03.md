# Memory - 2026-02-03

## Skills Cleanup Completed
- Moved 41 inactive skills from `_integrations/` to `available_skills/`
- Active skills: 19 (`_system/`) + 24 (`_integrations/`) = 43 total
- Created central index: `skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md`
- Updated `MEMORY.md` with clean structure

## Privacy Pool Status
- Cairo contract compiles successfully (Scarb 2.8.1)
- Sierra artifacts generated in `target/dev/`
- Deploy script: `scripts/deploy.py` (requires starknet.py + Python 3.10-3.12)
- Full ZK (Garaga) requires Scarb 2.14.0+ (deferred)

## Whale Tracker - Python 3.14 Compatibility
- Created `scripts/simple_check.py` (works without starknet.py)
- Tool executor updated with fallback import strategy
- Added to cron: `*/15 * * * *`
- Functions: get_whale_stats, get_crypto_price, get_market_metrics all working

## Tool Calling - All 4 Instruments OK
```
✅ get_crypto_price: OK
✅ get_crypto_prices: OK  
✅ get_whale_stats: OK
✅ get_market_metrics: OK
```

## Architecture Notes
- starknet.py incompatible with Python 3.14 (currently installed)
- Fallback strategy: direct module imports without package install
- Skills use importlib.util for dynamic loading in Python 3.14

## Cron Jobs Added
- Whale tracker simplified check: every 15 minutes
