# Daily Notes — 2026-02-01

## Loot Survivor 2 Tutorial
- Created comprehensive English tutorial for Loot Survivor 2 game on Starknet
- Covered: gameplay loop, exploration system, combat mechanics, stat allocation, type advantages, upgrade system, rewards
- Link: docs.provable.games/lootsurvivor/guide/

## Whale Tracker Enhancements
- Added comprehensive token list: ETH, STRK, USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, LINK, SNX, AAVE + memecoins (SLAY, BROTHER, SCHIZODIO, SISTER, FUMO, ZKOR)
- Added RPC failover (Lava → Blockpi → DRPC → Alchemy)
- Updated CoinGecko API to fetch more tokens

## New Skill: arbitrage-signal
- Created scanner that finds price differences between Ekubo/Jediswap/10k
- Outputs signals to stdout for Moltbot Telegram delivery
- No separate Telegram bot needed (uses Moltbot directly)

## Privacy Pool Research
- Wrote RESEARCH.md: cryptographically sound, Starknet ecosystem ready
- Key finding: Cairo contracts blocked by Scarb 2.8.1 bug → workaround: use Foundry
- Recommendation: build with compliance layer, deploy to Sepolia first
