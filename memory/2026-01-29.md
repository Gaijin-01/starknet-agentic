# 2026-01-29 — Session Notes

## EDITOR Skill Created
- Autonomous Text Style Engine inspired by xai-org/x-algorithm
- 6-stage pipeline: Intake → Classify → MetaController → Styler → Safety → Formatter
- Style parameters: fragmentation, irony, aggression, meme_density, myth_layer (0-100)
- Presets: normal (30%), ct (55%), shizo (70%), v-myaso (90%)
- Location: `skills/editor/`
- Git: `1a262d3` → `c4986a8` (religion removed)

## BotController Added
- High-level operational controller for Clawdbot + EDITOR
- Python implementation of bot.controller.js spec
- Defines 6 agents with roles and constraints
- Modes: auto, manual, dry_run
- Hard rules enforced: User override wins, Safety can't bypass
- Location: `skills/editor/bot_controller.py`
- Git: `f4d0351`

## OPERATIONAL_CAPABILITIES.md
- Documented knowledge scope, reasoning modes, text operations
- Style controls (schizo params), context handling, safety constraints
- Output formats, determinism notes, failure modes

## Code Fixes
- argparse syntax errors fixed
- AgentResult serialization fixed
- Topic typo (topings → topics) corrected
