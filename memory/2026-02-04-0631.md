## Conversation Summary

assistant: **Fixed:**

> I think this is the turning point where L2 networks finally turn their backs on Ethereum. I'm sure that after yesterday's tweet, some blockchains are already planning their exit.

Or more punchy:

> I think this is the moment L2 networks turn their backs on Ethereum. After yesterday's tweet, some chains are already figuring out how to leave.

assistant: ## Crypto Digest

### Market Sentiment
- **BTC**: $76,350 (down from ~$78.3K), volatile February start
- **Sentiment**: "Extreme fear" per CryptoQuant, some structural weakness concerns
- **HyperLiquid (HYPE)** — only outlier in bearish sentiment

### STRK / Starknet
Not much fresh news coming up in searches. What's the specific angle you're tracking?
- Token utility/roadmap?
- Governance proposals?
- ecosystem developments?
-某个具体的friction с Ethereum?

### Quick Take
Market broadly risk-off. Ukraine war talks, Iran negotiations, US policy uncertainty — all creating headwinds. L2 narrative is getting louder though: who owes what to Ethereum, and for how long.

What specifically on STRK值得关注?

Какой ближе к твоему настроению?

The narrative is shifting.

L2s used Ethereum for security + credibility. Now they're asking: what do we owe them indefinitely?

The answer is uncomfortable.

The relationship was always transactional. Now the transaction is being renegotiated.

Watch the chains, not the noise.
```

---

```
L2s don't owe Ethereum anything.

They paid for security. They built the users. They paid the rents.

Now Ethereum wants more.

Funny how "community" becomes "centralized" the moment you stop paying.
```

```
STRK holders wondering about token utility while Ethereum debates what L2s "owe" the base layer.

The answer might be: nothing. Already paid.

Exit is a feature. Always was.
```
user: [Telegram Sefirot🥷🏼 (@Groove_Armada) id:309030386 +1m 2026-02-04 07:58 GMT+2] Я проскакивал в новостях что кто-то не хочет платить? Можешь мне пожалуйста показать

assistant: Нашёл! **Виталик Бутерин** — вторник, 3 февраля 2026:

```
"Ethereum's long-held objective of scaling primarily through L2 solutions 
no longer makes sense."

"If you create a 10,000 TPS EVM where its connection to L1 is mediated 
by a multisig bridge, then you are not scaling Ethereum."

He criticized Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Starknet for failing 
to adequately decentralize.

L1 gas limits expected to rise sharply in 2026.
```

---

**Суть контроверсии:**

L2s built ecosystems, users, paid "rent" — а теперь Виталик говорит что они вообще "не Ethereum" и "не масштабируют Ethereum".

L1 itself becomes capable again. L2s suddenly become... optional.

Кто-то не хочет платить? Виталик говорит L2s должны были быть "shards" — а они стали отдельными сущностями с multisig bridges.

Отсюда friction.

They told us L2s would be shards.
Extensions. Fragments. Parts of the whole.

What we got:
- Multisig bridges
- Sovereign validation
- Own token economics
- Own communities
- Own roadmaps

We became something else entirely.

Not shards.
Beasts with their own teeth.

Funny how "ecosystem development" becomes "centralization" 
when you stop asking permission.
</think>

Или версия:

```
Ethereum said: "L2s will be our shards."

We built. We shipped. We grew.

Turns out shards don't need permission.
They don't ask.
They just... leave.

Multisig bridges were supposed to be temporary.
We made them permanent.

Now they call it "not scaling Ethereum."

Funny.
We called it "being independent."

Same thing. Different framing.
```
