**Pfeffer's Sunrise**

---

Once upon a time, people thought the future looked like this:

Protocols = networks = money = infinite value

Turns out?

Protocols are TCP/IP.

Forkable. Copyable. Open-source.

And TCP/IP?

Nobody owns it. Nobody makes money from it.

**The fork is coming.**

Every time a chain gets too expensive. Every time the rent-seeking becomes unbearable. Every time the protocol forgets who it serves.

A team somewhere. A GitHub repo. A new chain.

Same users. Same history. Better economics.

Users win. Token holders lose.

That's not a bug. That's **protocol economics**.

---

**So where does the value live?**

Not in the utility. Not in the infrastructure. Not in the DApp that does everything better.

Those all face the same math:

PQ is low. V is high. M = PQ/V

The math doesn't lie.

**Except...**

One use case.

One category.

Where forking doesn't destroy value.

Where being dominant is the whole point.

Where the network effect isn't optional.

**Store of Value.**

---

There's only room for one.

Maybe two.

The one that wins?

Wins **everything**.

Trillions.

Because money isn't utility. Money is *settlement*. 

You don't fork gold. You don't fork the dollar.

You fork a DApp. You fork a L2. You fork a protocol.

**You don't fork the base layer of monetary trust.**

---

**Pfeffer saw this in 2017.**

Wrote it down.

Called it "An Institutional Investor's Take."

Said: BTC is the only rational allocation.

Everything else?

Maybe overvalued.

---

**The sunrise happened.**

Bitcoin didn't fork.

Ethereum forked. Solana forked. Avalanche forked.

Every utility chain?

Forkable.

Every store of value chain?

**Not.**

That's the asymmetry.

That's the asymmetry nobody wanted to see.

---

**Utility dies.**

**Store of Value survives.**

Fork the protocol.

Not the money.

The money is the base.

The money is the settlement.

The money is **trust.**

Everything else?

Is just code.

user: [Telegram Sefirot🥷🏼 (@Groove_Armada) id:309030386 +24m 2026-02-04 19:52 GMT+2] In English [Replying to Hedgehog id:7555] John Pfeffer — "An Institutional Investor's Take on Cryptoassets" (Dec 2017) Core Framework 3 Categories of Cryptoassets: 1. Network backbone/VM (Ethereum) 2. DApps (decentralized apps) 3. Money (payments + store of value) Utility Protocols = Low Value at Equilibrium Equation: Network Value = PQ/V • PQ = cost of computing resources (processing, storage, bandwidth) • V = velocity of token circulation Key Problem: PQ is LOW and deflationary. V can be HIGH. "Scaling solutions like PoS, sharding, Lightning are bullish for adoption but bearish for token value." Protocol Forking = Value Destruction: • Open-source protocols can be copied freely • Like Facebook devs flipping a switch to create a clone • This maximizes user utility but suppresses token holder rent Metcalfe's Law Trap: • Network value ≠ just n(n-1) • Must consider 0 (revenue model) • Wikipedia has millions of users but zero monetary value (no business model) The ONE Exception Store of Value Cryptoasset = Trillions in Value • Only scenario where token holders capture sustainable rent • Dominant non-sovereign monetary store of value • Bitcoin is the leading candidate "Rational for investors to allocate a small portion of assets to BTC with long-term horizon." Bottom Line (2017 Pfeffer) | Category | Value at Equilibrium | | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | | Utility protocols (Ethereum, DApps) | Relatively low | | Store of Value (Bitcoin) | Many trillions | His call: Small BTC allocation makes sense. Most other crypto = overvalued relative to fundamental utility. Relevance today (2026): • ETH transitioned to PoS (done) • L2 scaling exploded (done) • Bitcoin = $X (still store of value narrative) • Utility tokens = mostly failed to capture rent as predicted Сильный документ для 2017 — многое сбылось. 🐺 [/Replying]

assistant: Nice work. 🐺🔥

The structure is clean:
- Framework first
- The math (PQ/V)
- The fork paradox
- The one exception

Short, quotable, punchy.

**One thought to consider adding:**

The irony that Ethereum tried to become both — and ended up as infrastructure (utility) while BTC stayed pure (store of value).

Ethereum now powers everything but captures almost no rent.

Bitcoin powers nothing but captures the narrative.

**The fork didn't kill BTC.**

**It killed the utility thesis.**
